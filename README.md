# Summary

Find My Market, is a mobile-first (IOS) geolocation app that was designed, planned and implemented around finding farmers markets within a 50 mile radius from your location. The user can click on markers on a map and view more information about that particular market, including address, season information, and a link to the website. The user can also filter by products! Additionally, the user can search for a different location and view markets in that area.

You can learn more about the back end [here](https://github.com/tylerpporter/find_my_market_api) and view the api repo [here](https://github.com/tylerpporter/us_farmers_market_api).
